Insightful Analysis Ideas:
--------------------------

**Performance Drivers Analysis:**

*   Multi-factor correlation analysis between study habits, sleep, diet quality, and exam scores
    
*   "Sweet spot" identification for optimal study hours vs. diminishing returns
    
*   Lifestyle balance scoring that combines multiple health factors
    

**Behavioral Segmentation:**

*   Student persona clustering (e.g., "Balanced Achievers," "Screen-Heavy Strugglers," "Social Butterflies")
    
*   Risk profiling for academic underperformance based on lifestyle patterns
    
*   Engagement vs. Performance matrix plotting extracurricular participation against grades
    

**Predictive Insights:**

*   Early warning system identifying students at risk based on attendance and lifestyle factors
    
*   Optimal lifestyle recommendations based on high-performing student patterns
    
*   Time allocation efficiency analysis
    

**Creative Visualizations:**

*   "Student Journey" flow diagrams showing how habits evolve with performance
    
*   Interactive "What-if" scenarios for habit changes
    
*   Heat maps showing lifestyle pattern clusters

**Additional Analysis Ideas for Your Dataset:**
-----------------------------------------------

**Advanced Analytics:**

*   **Time allocation efficiency**: Compare study hours vs. actual performance gains
    
*   **Habit clustering**: Identify which combination of habits predict success
    
*   **Intervention tracking**: Monitor changes after implementing recommendations
    
*   **Peer comparison**: Benchmark students against similar demographic groups
    

**Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Early warning system**: Flag students likely to struggle before mid-terms
    
*   **Success probability**: Predict final grades based on current habits
    
*   **Optimal scheduling**: Recommend study/rest patterns for each student type
    

**Creative Visualizations:**
